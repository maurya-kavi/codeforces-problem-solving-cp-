There are $$$n$$$ shops around that sell sugar: the $$$i$$$-th shop sells one pack of sugar for $$$a_i$$$ coins, but only <span class="tex-font-style-bf">one pack to one customer</span> each day. So in order to buy several packs, you need to visit several shops.</p><p>Another problem is that prices are increasing each day: during the first day the cost is $$$a_i$$$, during the second day cost is $$$a_i + 1$$$, during the third day — $$$a_i + 2$$$ and so on for each shop $$$i$$$.</p><p>On the contrary, your everyday budget is only $$$x$$$ coins. In other words, each day you go and buy as many packs as possible with total cost not exceeding $$$x$$$. Note that if you don't spend some amount of coins during a day, you can't use these coins during the next days.</p><p>Eventually, the cost for each pack will exceed $$$x$$$, and you won't be able to buy even a single pack. So, how many packs will you be able to buy till that moment in total?</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.

At day $$$501$$$ prices are $$$[501, 501]$$$, so you can buy only $$$1$$$ pack the next $$$500$$$ days. At day $$$1001$$$ prices are $$$[1001, 1001]$$$ so can't buy anymore. In total, you bought $$$500 \cdot 2 + 500 \cdot 1 = 1500$$$ packs.</p></div>
