For the house numbered $$$2$$$, the sum of distances is $$$|2 - 1| + |2 - 2| + |2 - 3| + |2 - 4| = 4$$$, and for the house numbered $$$3$$$, the sum of distances is $$$|3 - 1| + |3 - 2| + |3 - 3| + |3 - 4| = 4$$$. However, for the house numbered $$$1$$$, the sum of distances will be $$$|1 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |1 - 3| + |1 - 4| = 6$$$, so the house numbered $$$1$$$ is not suitable. It can also be proven that Sasha cannot buy apartments in other houses.</p><p>In the second test case, the suitable houses are numbered $$$6$$$ and $$$7$$$. For Sasha to choose the house numbered $$$6$$$, it is sufficient that none of the bars close. For Sasha to choose the house numbered $$$7$$$, the bars in houses $$$1$$$ and $$$6$$$ can close. Then the bars will be located in houses numbered $$$6$$$, $$$7$$$, and $$$7$$$.</p></div>
